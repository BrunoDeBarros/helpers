# Helpers

A set of code snippets, helper functions and libraries for reuse across projects.

They are unit-tested and analysed with SensionLabsInsight. Backward compatibility is important when making changes, to make sure that they continue to work as expected through all projects.

To use it in a project:

```
composer require brunodebarros/helpers dev-master
```
